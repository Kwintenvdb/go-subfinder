1
00:07:05,147 --> 00:07:06,206
Good morning.

2
00:07:06,372 --> 00:07:07,683
Hi. Thanks for letting me

3
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:08,744
- sleep here.
- Of course.

4
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:09,937
No, I didn't wake
you up this morning.

5
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,230
I figured maybe you
needed the rest.

6
00:07:11,255 --> 00:07:12,776
Here's a coffee. And
I got some bread.

7
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:14,037
Anything on Pol?

8
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,543
So I went to the Meicho.

9
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,235
I spoke to the guy
who covers Yoshino

10
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,564
and all the little
towns in that area.

11
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:24,010
And they have not seen or heard
of any gaijin, any foreigners.

12
00:07:24,035 --> 00:07:26,320
So I think we should file
a missing persons report.

13
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:31,188
- Mm. Yeah. Yeah.
- That's a great idea.

14
00:07:31,213 --> 00:07:33,448
That is a fucking
brilliant plan.

15
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,454
You know, the Japanese
police department,

16
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,727
they love to waste
their whole fucking day

17
00:07:37,752 --> 00:07:40,856
looking for a gaijin girl
who skipped out on her debts.

18
00:07:41,575 --> 00:07:43,702
Is there any way that
Polina just went home?

19
00:07:43,727 --> 00:07:45,323
No. She didn't go home.

20
00:07:45,948 --> 00:07:47,283
Why? Are you sure?

21
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:48,901
I'm fucking sure.

22
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,641
Don't ask stupid
fucking questions.

23
00:07:51,476 --> 00:07:52,476
- Okay.

24
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,896
- Sorry.

25
00:07:54,462 --> 00:07:55,538
I'm sorry.

26
00:07:56,615 --> 00:07:59,034
- No, it's okay.
- You want to smoke?

27
00:08:02,996 --> 00:08:04,232
Listen,

28
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:08,646
Pol's my best friend,
but she's so openhearted.

29
00:08:08,671 --> 00:08:12,432
She's very trusting. She
trusts people way too much.

30
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:13,892
She's so agreeable.

31
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:16,495
One night I was at Onyx, and
I was feeling really shitty,

32
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,889
and she came over to me
and ended up taking me

33
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:20,142
to her favorite
place in Tokyo and...

34
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,443
- The shrine?
- Yeah.

35
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,389
- See?
- That's what I'm talking about.

36
00:08:23,642 --> 00:08:26,270
Where did you hear
about Yoshino?

37
00:08:26,342 --> 00:08:27,927
The tip about Yoshino?

38
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:30,147
The host club that
she owes money to.

39
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:31,761
Okay. So we go back there.

40
00:08:31,786 --> 00:08:32,846
We see what else we
can get out of them.

41
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,637
- No, no.
- Sato got it out of them.

42
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:36,922
And it turns out that
the club's in deep

43
00:08:36,947 --> 00:08:39,018
with Sato's boss's, like,
mortal fucking enemy.

44
00:08:39,043 --> 00:08:40,962
- Tozawa?
- Yeah. And Sato got spooked.

45
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,489
So he'll never go back there.

46
00:08:42,514 --> 00:08:44,808
Wait. Okay. So this is great.

47
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,769
If Yoshino has anything to
do with Tozawa's operations,

48
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,625
I know a guy who knows

49
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,447
more about Tozawa's
operations than anybody.

50
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:53,282
- Okay. That's great.
- Let's talk to them.

51
00:08:53,307 --> 00:08:54,933
Okay, the only thing is,

52
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,261
if we're gonna get
this guy to talk to us,

53
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,580
we're gonna have to go
to him with an offering.

54
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,390
Okay. Like what?

55
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:02,957
You have any idea where we
can score some crystal meth?

56
00:09:04,821 --> 00:09:08,951
<font color="#ff6fec"><i>Improved Sync By M_I_S
www.opensubtitles.org</i></font>

57
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:20,663
Whoa, this is fucking cool.

58
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,814
Hey, who are you?

59
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,525
We met in a hostel in
Asakusa, right, Jake?

60
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,658
Yeah.

61
00:16:25,683 --> 00:16:27,166
He saw I was
reading your article

62
00:16:27,191 --> 00:16:28,525
on the Tozawa-gumi.
I'm obsessed.

63
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,531
And he said he knew the writer.

64
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:31,769
I thought he was
flirting with me,

65
00:16:31,793 --> 00:16:33,575
but you know the fucking writer!

66
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,828
- She's cool, right?
- She's into this stuff too.

67
00:16:35,853 --> 00:16:38,222
You ever gonna write about
Tozawa's plans in Tokyo?

68
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,188
- No, I write in my book, okay?
- Oh, yeah, the book.

69
00:16:41,213 --> 00:16:42,477
He's writing a book
too. Isn't that cool?

70
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,377
- So cool.
- Yeah.

71
00:16:43,428 --> 00:16:46,255
And, uh... we were
talking earlier.

72
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,097
We're really curious
about, uh, Yoshino.

73
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,926
- Mm-hmm.
- Yoshino?

74
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,873
It's like some deal that
Tozawa's got going on.

75
00:16:52,898 --> 00:16:54,888
Sends girls who get
into debt there.

76
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,765
Hey, who you work for? Huh?

77
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,874
Um...

78
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,614
You're a newspaper man, right?

79
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,328
- No.
- How you know about Yoshino?

80
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,647
- Jake, Jake.
- I know it. I know it.

81
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,606
Give it to him.

82
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,012
- Take it easy.
- Give it to him.

83
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:09,945
Look, purest crystal
you're ever gonna get.

84
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,556
We know that Tozawa's got
something going on in Yoshino,

85
00:17:12,581 --> 00:17:14,128
we think our friend is there.

86
00:17:14,536 --> 00:17:16,227
Tell us what you
know about Yoshino,

87
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:17,545
and this is yours.

88
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:21,121
Yeah.

89
00:17:21,712 --> 00:17:23,434
Yeah, I know about Yoshino.

90
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:27,396
Yeah, I'll tell you if you
party with me right now.

91
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,125
Little shabu, little
music, then I tell you.

92
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,720
Everybody happy, yeah?

93
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:32,661
- Yeah.
- I'm not...

94
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:33,717
Yeah, sure. Fine. We'll do it.

95
00:17:33,742 --> 00:17:35,267
No, no, no. I'm not...

96
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:37,286
I'm...

97
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,458
- Don't move.
- Okay.

98
00:17:39,622 --> 00:17:40,976
Wait, what the
fuck are you doing?

99
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:42,821
I'm not... I'm not doing shabu.

100
00:17:42,846 --> 00:17:44,162
What if I have a
heart attack and die?

101
00:17:44,186 --> 00:17:45,665
- What's wrong with you?
- You have a condition?

102
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,688
- Yeah. I have a condition.
- I'm fucking scared.

103
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:49,443
I don't do hard drugs. I've
never done any hard drugs.

104
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:51,487
- Okay. Don't be scared.
- I've done this before.

105
00:17:51,512 --> 00:17:52,989
I've done it with
the girls at Onyx.

106
00:17:53,014 --> 00:17:54,727
I got this from them,
it's probably good.

107
00:17:54,752 --> 00:17:56,325
We smoke, get what we came for,

108
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,894
and get the fuck out.
Come on, Jake, look at me.

109
00:17:57,918 --> 00:17:58,912
Should have made a
better deal than that.

110
00:17:58,937 --> 00:18:00,604
Trust me. Trust me.

111
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:03,068
Just go easy, okay?

112
00:18:39,758 --> 00:18:41,009
Did I take too much?

113
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,288
What the fuck are you doing?

114
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,666
I said to take it easy.

115
00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:49,317
Come. Dance.

116
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,566
Whoa.

117
00:19:00,324 --> 00:19:02,558
- Good, right?
- Yeah.

118
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:04,265
My mix.

119
00:19:04,796 --> 00:19:06,168
It's fucking great.

120
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,734
Okay, tell me about Yoshino.

121
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:14,070
We're gonna have a
good time, right?

122
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:15,482
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Fucking tell me.

123
00:19:15,506 --> 00:19:16,882
Come on. Come on, man.

124
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,782
I'm smoked your meth.
Come on, tell me.

125
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:21,677
- Okay. I'll tell you.
- All right.

126
00:19:23,713 --> 00:19:25,113
Tozawa Kumicho,

127
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:28,550
he make parties
there for friends

128
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,523
and business people

129
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,521
to have sex with models
and beautiful girls.

130
00:19:34,684 --> 00:19:36,881
Get paid so much money.

131
00:19:37,262 --> 00:19:39,443
Guest list, amazing.

132
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,745
Where in Yoshino? Where is it?

133
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,475
Where the fuck in Yoshino is it?

134
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,603
Come on, fucking tell me.
Where is it in Yoshino?

135
00:19:47,628 --> 00:19:49,024
Address?

136
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:52,368
Yoshino is name of his ship.

137
00:19:53,273 --> 00:19:54,649
It's a boat?

138
00:20:03,254 --> 00:20:05,032
Where does it sail from?

139
00:20:05,711 --> 00:20:07,653
The boat, where does
the boat sail from?

140
00:20:07,678 --> 00:20:09,040
I don't know.

141
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:15,631
But if I get invitation,
maybe you come.

142
00:20:15,656 --> 00:20:17,157
Yeah?

143
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:19,343
- Yeah. Okay.
- I look forward to...

144
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,574
Jake, it's time to go. Come on.

145
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:23,263
- No, no, it's not time, okay?
- Already?

146
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,879
Now is party time, all right?

147
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:25,891
Mm-mm.

148
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:29,588
Whoa, get the fuck off her.

149
00:20:29,613 --> 00:20:31,802
- My hero.
- Yeah, what the...

150
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,525
Jake, let's go. Come on.

151
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,613
Holy shit.

152
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:43,501
Okay. Wrong way.

153
00:20:44,024 --> 00:20:45,150
- Other way.
- Okay.

154
00:20:45,175 --> 00:20:46,801
Go, go, go, go, go.

155
00:20:47,031 --> 00:20:49,723
No fucking way. Polina
is not on a sex cruise.

156
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:53,043
She wouldn't let a client put
a hand on her fucking knee.

157
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:54,695
- I feel...
- Come on, come on.

158
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,639
- I feel good!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

159
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,131
Of course you feel good.

160
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,342
You hit that pipe
like a fucking bong.

161
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,802
I feel like I can do anything.

162
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,160
- Stop.
- Okay, you need to calm down.

163
00:21:03,184 --> 00:21:05,592
- No, I can't.
- I can't fucking do it!

164
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:08,119
- I just smoked meth.
- Jake, come on.

165
00:21:08,196 --> 00:21:10,446
Jake, come on!

166
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:13,455
Okay. Okay, focus.

167
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,023
- Yeah.
- Come on, eyes here.

168
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,025
- Yeah.
- Yoshino...

169
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,444
Yoshino.

170
00:21:18,469 --> 00:21:19,587
It's not a place, it's a boat.

171
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,205
- It's a boat?
- It's a boat.

172
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,855
Tozawa uses it to get his
business associates laid.

173
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,431
It's fucking sick. It's
fucking hand out favors.

174
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,763
- Polina's on it?
- I don't know.

175
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,279
That is what we
have to find out.

176
00:21:31,304 --> 00:21:32,992
We have to find out
where the boat is...

177
00:21:33,017 --> 00:21:33,944
Nobody wants to
help me with this.

178
00:21:33,969 --> 00:21:35,311
- And if she's on it.
- Nobody wants to fucking help me.

179
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,717
- Can you calm down?
- I fucked my sources up...

180
00:21:36,741 --> 00:21:38,350
- Really, you gotta calm down.
- They don't trust me.

181
00:21:38,374 --> 00:21:39,690
And by the way, I don't
really trust them.

182
00:21:39,714 --> 00:21:41,904
I feel like everybody
is manipulating me.

183
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:43,477
Everyone's lying to me.
No one tells me the truth.

184
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:44,501
Come here.

185
00:22:01,973 --> 00:22:03,670
Hey. Okay.

186
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:09,943
Okay.

187
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,052
You're a really
interesting person.

188
00:22:18,316 --> 00:22:20,361
Oh, my God. It's my boss.

189
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,635
Oh, my God, I fucking...

190
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,984
Okay, wait, wait,
yeah. Okay. Yeah.

191
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,578
We're-we're gonna go back...
I'm gonna go back to work.

192
00:22:25,602 --> 00:22:26,455
Okay.

193
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,706
And I'm gonna put
some feelers out

194
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,730
about the sex cruises.

195
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:31,202
- Here, take this in case you need it.
- Jake: And we are...

196
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,810
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yes.

197
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:35,378
- Yeah, I'm gonna be good.
- You sure?

198
00:22:35,403 --> 00:22:36,834
- We're gonna find her.
- Okay.

199
00:22:37,073 --> 00:22:38,763
- Hey, Jake...
- We're gonna find her.

200
00:22:39,307 --> 00:22:42,351
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

201
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,504
- Call me, okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

202
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:49,460
Okay. Bye.

203
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,573
Oi! Oi!

204
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,823
Oi!

205
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:30,910
Speaking.

206
00:26:36,481 --> 00:26:40,110
That is very welcome news.

207
00:26:41,878 --> 00:26:44,005
Yes. Tonight.

208
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:48,680
I understand. Thank you.

209
00:29:02,924 --> 00:29:03,786
Hey.

210
00:29:03,811 --> 00:29:05,301
- Ho!
- We're going to the Meicho.

211
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,252
You want to come?

212
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:07,970
I'd love to, but I
gotta do something here.

213
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,298
And that's a great neck tie.

214
00:29:10,873 --> 00:29:12,500
It's new. It's a new one, right?

215
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,193
Thank you. But it's not.

216
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,598
Where have you been?

217
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:19,048
Oh, I've been out
chasing a story.

218
00:29:19,073 --> 00:29:19,980
Okay.

219
00:29:20,005 --> 00:29:21,173
It's about this, uh,

220
00:29:21,225 --> 00:29:22,981
this hostess I know
has a colleague,

221
00:29:23,006 --> 00:29:25,631
a friend, another
hostess who went missing.

222
00:29:26,044 --> 00:29:28,546
She racked up this
debt at a host club,

223
00:29:28,571 --> 00:29:30,685
and she may have
been forced to go

224
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,921
on a secret Tozawa sex cruise.

225
00:29:33,016 --> 00:29:34,414
That's her, this one.

226
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,940
What's the girl's name?

227
00:29:35,965 --> 00:29:37,791
Her name is Polina. And...

228
00:29:37,816 --> 00:29:39,384
How long has Polina
been missing?

229
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:40,862
Since Friday morning.

230
00:29:40,887 --> 00:29:42,686
Her roommate was the
last one to see her.

231
00:29:42,711 --> 00:29:45,566
I know the name of the
boat, the sex cruise.

232
00:29:45,591 --> 00:29:46,805
I already know the name.

233
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:50,573
So I'm gonna make some calls
and see what I can find out.

234
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,765
Uh, are the phones
here safe to use,

235
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,908
or should I be using
my mobile phone?

236
00:29:53,932 --> 00:29:55,581
Which one's better?
I'm not sure.

237
00:29:56,265 --> 00:29:58,809
- What?
- Are you high right now?

238
00:30:01,536 --> 00:30:03,747
- You're good.
- What did you do?

239
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:05,751
I did meth with a source

240
00:30:05,776 --> 00:30:08,070
because it was the only way
I could get the information.

241
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:10,266
I'm not sure if you're
completely insane

242
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:13,066
or the most dedicated reporter
I've ever worked with.

243
00:30:13,696 --> 00:30:15,121
- Jake...
- Yeah.

244
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:18,936
- Go before someone notices.
- Okay. Okay.

245
00:30:19,096 --> 00:30:20,347
I'll fax the photo

246
00:30:20,372 --> 00:30:22,070
to my contacts in
Missing Persons

247
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,569
and call you if
any hits come up.

248
00:30:23,594 --> 00:30:24,617
Yeah, I'll make calls from home.

249
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:25,669
- Go.
- Okay, bye.

250
00:30:26,473 --> 00:30:27,891
You're the best.

251
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,141
Samantha!

252
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,086
What the fuck are
you talking about?

253
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,025
Polina. They took her.

254
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,235
What? The guys from the boat?

255
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,751
- What boat?
- There's no fucking boat.

256
00:32:27,775 --> 00:32:29,447
Men called and
say they took her.

257
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,074
They say she gave
them my number.

258
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:34,241
- Well, I want to... I want to...
- I want to fucking talk to them.

259
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:35,093
- Call them.
- I tried.

260
00:32:35,118 --> 00:32:37,372
- Call them!
- I tried. It's unknown number.

261
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,877
- What do they want?
- We have to help her.

262
00:32:38,901 --> 00:32:40,141
What do they want?

263
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,460
Everything she owes them.

264
00:32:41,485 --> 00:32:43,111
10 million yen plus interest.

265
00:32:43,136 --> 00:32:44,735
You fucking asshole.

266
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,049
- It's my fault.
- She was in debt because of me.

267
00:32:48,074 --> 00:32:51,161
I know what you think, but
I have feelings for her.

268
00:32:51,186 --> 00:32:52,720
But I don't have that much cash.

269
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,888
Please help me.

270
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:55,524
If they don't get it all today,

271
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:57,295
they say they're gonna kill her.

272
00:32:57,568 --> 00:32:59,236
I'm serious, please.

273
00:33:04,411 --> 00:33:06,371
- How much can you get?
- I don't know.

274
00:33:06,506 --> 00:33:09,011
2... 2, 3 million
yen? How about you?

275
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:13,868
Call me in an hour.

276
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,546
Samantha!

277
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,427
Hurry up.

278
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,077
- They should be here.
- What are we looking for?

279
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,913
- The guy told me a blue van.
- You okay?

280
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,582
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

281
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,108
I'm about to hand over every yen

282
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,943
I have in the world.
If you fuck me over...

283
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,528
We both want her safe.

284
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,956
Blue van.

285
00:37:07,921 --> 00:37:09,171
Give me your bag, I'll do it.

286
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:08,348
- What are you doing?
- Shut up.

287
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,554
You don't have her.

288
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:31,450
You don't have her. These
guys are so full of shit.

289
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,514
Ah!

290
00:38:32,994 --> 00:38:33,994
Oh, shit.

291
00:38:34,135 --> 00:38:36,147
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

292
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,230
No!

293
00:38:40,898 --> 00:38:42,138
Sorry!

294
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:48,135
No, no, no! No!

295
00:38:48,496 --> 00:38:49,910
No, no!

296
00:40:29,006 --> 00:40:31,220
This just seems too urgent.

297
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:34,869
- The money's been wired to me.
- I just can't access it yet.

298
00:40:34,894 --> 00:40:37,306
You know, some technicality.
You know how these things are.

299
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,747
I just need a bridge
loan for a few days.

300
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,859
Miss, no legitimate
loan companies

301
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,987
will ever lend you money for
a business in mizu shobai.

302
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:54,288
Maeda-san, I have to
make the final payment

303
00:40:54,501 --> 00:40:58,145
to purchase my club
now, or I lose it.

304
00:40:58,494 --> 00:40:59,827
You have no assets,

305
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,483
no family, no collateral
if you cannot pay.

306
00:41:07,734 --> 00:41:09,248
I'm sorry.

307
00:41:35,637 --> 00:41:37,072
Oh, shit.

308
00:42:05,379 --> 00:42:06,859
- Duke.
- Hmm.

309
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,111
You are early,

310
00:42:11,994 --> 00:42:13,287
for a change.

311
00:42:15,453 --> 00:42:16,579
Can we talk?

312
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,996
I need a favor.

313
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:32,613
Hello, you've reached
the Adelsteins.

314
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,274
Neither Eddie, Willa,
Josh, nor Jessica

315
00:42:34,299 --> 00:42:35,926
are here right now.

316
00:42:35,951 --> 00:42:37,613
Please leave your
full name and number,

317
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,974
slowly and clearly, and
we'll get back to you.

318
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:42,451
Hey, it's me.

319
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,203
I just wanted to call and check

320
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,906
and see how everyone's doing.

321
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,858
- Josh.
- Hey, Dad?

322
00:42:51,217 --> 00:42:53,044
I'm glad I couldn't sleep.

323
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:59,660
I've just been, uh,
catching up on some work.

324
00:43:03,906 --> 00:43:05,723
It's good to hear your voice.

325
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:10,842
Yeah, sorry I haven't
been better about calling.

326
00:43:10,867 --> 00:43:13,924
Uh, it's just been really busy.

327
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,280
I'm sure.

328
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,496
Well, take care of yourself.

329
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,411
Your mother worries.

330
00:43:25,279 --> 00:43:26,768
How's Jessica?

331
00:43:28,047 --> 00:43:29,966
Are you really asking,
or am I just supposed

332
00:43:29,991 --> 00:43:31,232
to say everything's great?

333
00:43:31,257 --> 00:43:34,187
- Can we not argue?
- Let's not argue.

334
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:36,662
Um, uh, yeah, I want to
know how she really is.

335
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:40,231
She's not good.

336
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,246
I know she tells you she's fine.

337
00:43:44,271 --> 00:43:47,607
She needs you to believe
that, but it's, uh...

338
00:43:49,406 --> 00:43:51,216
It's very bad again.

339
00:43:56,113 --> 00:43:57,743
What if I came home?

340
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,889
Is that what you
really want, son?

341
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,269
Josh?

342
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,977
You sound tired.

343
00:44:15,078 --> 00:44:16,413
Get some sleep.

344
00:44:17,786 --> 00:44:20,556
When you wake up, if you
still want to come home,

345
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,857
I'll buy you the ticket myself.

346
00:44:24,117 --> 00:44:25,354
Tomorrow.

347
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,143
Okay?

348
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:57,444
Hey. What are you doing here?

349
00:44:58,267 --> 00:44:59,434
- Oi.
- Sato.

350
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,175
Hai.

351
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:14,482
If you came here to talk
me out of it, don't.

352
00:53:15,406 --> 00:53:19,423
- It's too late for that.
- Oyabun wants to do business.

353
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,691
That's great news.

354
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:26,648
Samantha, you should know
who you are in business with.

355
00:53:28,018 --> 00:53:30,088
I know the risk I'm taking.

356
00:53:30,429 --> 00:53:34,059
I'm very aware of how fucking
wrong this could go for me.

357
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,227
Then why are you doing this?

358
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,826
Because I'm not
giving up my club.

359
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,443
I've worked too hard.

360
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:45,751
I've done too many things
to make this happen.

361
00:53:46,621 --> 00:53:48,112
And it will make money.

362
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:54,476
What? Come on.

363
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,818
Nothing.

364
00:54:00,701 --> 00:54:03,162
Any word about
your friend Polina?

365
00:54:08,885 --> 00:54:10,092
I am sorry.

366
00:54:11,088 --> 00:54:12,238
Truly.

367
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,177
The funds will be placed

368
00:54:23,202 --> 00:54:25,539
in an account in your
name tomorrow afternoon.

369
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:28,940
I have been put in charge
of dealing with your club.

370
00:54:30,045 --> 00:54:31,781
I hope that won't be a problem.

371
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,970
No. You?

372
00:54:37,577 --> 00:54:38,700
No.

373
00:54:40,455 --> 00:54:42,567
We will keep things
professional.

374
00:54:44,401 --> 00:54:45,898
Absolutely.

375
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,447
New beginning.

376
00:54:53,617 --> 00:54:55,011
I'd like that.

377
00:54:57,019 --> 00:54:58,085
Me too.

378
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,568
- Good night.
- Night.

379
00:59:37,811 --> 00:59:40,660
Hey, we have time, no?

380
00:59:40,685 --> 00:59:42,404
We have plenty of time.

381
00:59:42,616 --> 00:59:45,271
Come on, we have all
night. Yes, I know.

382
00:59:45,296 --> 00:59:47,131
I thought you would
like that one.

383
00:59:47,691 --> 00:59:49,997
Hey, come on. No, no, no.

384
00:59:50,685 --> 00:59:53,605
Get off me. Get
off me. Get off me!

385
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:56,551
Don't fucking...

386
00:59:56,576 --> 00:59:57,997
How dare you touch me like that?

387
00:59:58,022 --> 00:59:59,415
Don't touch me like that.

388
00:59:59,717 --> 01:00:00,717
Hey.

389
01:00:01,553 --> 01:00:03,271
Are you crazy?

390
01:00:26,313 --> 01:00:28,719
This... this mister attacked me.

391
01:00:28,744 --> 01:00:30,918
This is not part
of our agreement.

392
01:00:35,182 --> 01:00:37,175
Don't touch me. Don't touch...

393
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,610
Don't fucking touch me!

394
01:00:39,635 --> 01:00:42,764
No, no, no! Don't!

395
01:01:05,576 --> 01:01:07,021
Oi. Oi!

396
01:02:02,013 --> 01:02:03,389
What happened to you?

397
01:02:04,311 --> 01:02:05,746
Where's the family?

398
01:02:07,564 --> 01:02:08,857
Out of town.

399
01:02:09,081 --> 01:02:11,208
I've got something
you need to see.

400
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,492
Look, I know that I fucked up.

401
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,638
I know you don't trust me.

402
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:23,072
But I'm here asking
for a second chance.

403
01:02:24,608 --> 01:02:25,668
Please.

404
01:02:33,584 --> 01:02:35,652
Make sure you were not followed.
